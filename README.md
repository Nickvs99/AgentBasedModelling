#### TODO:
<ul>
  <li> - [x] Grid + Model + Agents</li>
  <li> - [x] Implemented agent segregation and server visualisation
  <li> - [x] Add neutral agents
  <li> - [] Implement from mesa time, import randomtime(random scheduler for randomized step agent order ? </li>
  <li> - [] Add homophily and happiness atrributes/ and density/minority_pc from shelling example (also add effects of having neutral agent to this)</li>
  <li> - [] Spatial component -> influence of schools on happiness(Blocks in grid with spatial component which increase happiness) </li>
  <li> - [] Geo-shelling/polygons instead of grid</li>
</ul>
