# AgentBasedModelling
<p>Global parameters?/ some parameters are double unnecessary, clean-up</p>
<p>Do we want to change from choosing number of each agents type, to have parameters choosing density, proportion minority agents and proportion neutral agents. Same number parameters however could be more user friendly?</p>
<p> Start -> happy agents are rectangles. Once moved unhappy agents stay unhappy (circles) for one step before becoming happy (rect), should be happy straight away? </p>
<p>Parameter distance neighbourhood?</p>

#### TODO:
<ul>
  <li> - [x] Grid + Model + Agents</li>
  <li> - [x] Implemented agent segregation and server visualisation
  <li> - [x] Add neutral agents
  <li> - [x] Implement RandomScheduler</li>
  <li> - [x] Add homophily and happiness atrributes/ and density/minority_pc from shelling example (also add effects of having neutral agent to this)</li>
  <li> - [] Spatial component -> influence of schools on happiness(Blocks in grid with spatial component which increase happiness) </li>
  <li> - [] Geo-shelling/polygons instead of grid</li>
</ul>
